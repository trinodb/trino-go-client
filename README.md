## Requirements

* Go 1.17 or newer
* Trino 372 or newer

## Installation

You need a working environment with Go installed and $GOPATH set.

Download and install Trino database/sql driver:

```bash
go get github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client/trino
```

Make sure you have Git installed and in your $PATH.

## Usage

This Trino client is an implementation of Go's `database/sql/driver` interface. In order to use it, you need to import the package and use the  [`database/sql`](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/) API then.

Only read operations are supported, such as SHOW and SELECT.

Use `trino` as `driverName` and a valid [DSN](#dsn-data-source-name) as the `dataSourceName`.

Example:

```go
import "database/sql"
import _ "github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client/trino"

dsn := "http://user@localhost:8080?catalog=default&schema=test"
db, err := sql.Open("trino", dsn)
```

### Authentication

Both HTTP Basic and Kerberos authentication are supported.

#### HTTP Basic authentication

If the DSN contains a password, the client enables HTTP Basic authentication by setting the `Authorization` header in every request to Trino.

HTTP Basic authentication **is only supported on encrypted connections over HTTPS**.

#### Kerberos authentication

This driver supports Kerberos authentication by setting up the Kerberos fields in the [Config](https://godoc.org/github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client/trino#Config) struct.

Please refer to the [Coordinator Kerberos Authentication](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/server.html) for server-side configuration.

#### System access control and per-query user information

It's possible to pass user information to Trino, different from the principal used to authenticate to the coordinator. See the [System Access Control](https://trino.io/docs/current/develop/system-access-control.html) documentation for details.

In order to pass user information in queries to Trino, you have to add a [NamedArg](https://godoc.org/database/sql#NamedArg) to the query parameters where the key is X-Trino-User.
This parameter is used by the driver to inform Trino about the user executing the query regardless of the authentication method for the actual connection, and its value is NOT passed to the query.

Example:

```go
db.Query("SELECT * FROM foobar WHERE id=?", 1, sql.Named("X-Trino-User", string("Alice")))
```

The position of the X-Trino-User NamedArg is irrelevant and does not affect the query in any way.

### DSN (Data Source Name)

The Data Source Name is a URL with a mandatory username, and optional query string parameters that are supported by this driver, in the following format:

```
http[s]://user[:pass]@host[:port][?parameters]
```

The easiest way to build your DSN is by using the [Config.FormatDSN](https://godoc.org/github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client/trino#Config.FormatDSN) helper function.

The driver supports both HTTP and HTTPS. If you use HTTPS it's recommended that you also provide a custom `http.Client` that can validate (or skip) the security checks of the server certificate, and/or to configure TLS client authentication.

#### Parameters

*Parameters are case-sensitive*

Refer to the [Trino Concepts](https://trino.io/docs/current/overview/concepts.html) documentation for more information.

##### `source`

```
Type:           string
Valid values:   string describing the source of the connection to Trino
Default:        empty
```

The `source` parameter is optional, but if used, can help Trino admins troubleshoot queries and trace them back to the original client.

##### `catalog`

```
Type:           string
Valid values:   the name of a catalog configured in the Trino server
Default:        empty
```

The `catalog` parameter defines the Trino catalog where schemas exist to organize tables.

##### `schema`

```
Type:           string
Valid values:   the name of an existing schema in the catalog
Default:        empty
```

The `schema` parameter defines the Trino schema where tables exist. This is also known as namespace in some environments.

##### `session_properties`

```
Type:           string
Valid values:   comma-separated list of key=value session properties
Default:        empty
```

The `session_properties` parameter must contain valid parameters accepted by the Trino server. Run `SHOW SESSION` in Trino to get the current list.

##### `custom_client`

```
Type:           string
Valid values:   the name of a client previously registered to the driver
Default:        empty (defaults to http.DefaultClient)
```

The `custom_client` parameter allows the use of custom `http.Client` for the communication with Trino.

Register your custom client in the driver, then refer to it by name in the DSN, on the call to `sql.Open`:

```go
foobarClient := &http.Client{
    Transport: &http.Transport{
        Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
        DialContext: (&net.Dialer{
            Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
            KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
            DualStack: true,
        }).DialContext,
        MaxIdleConns:          100,
        IdleConnTimeout:       90 * time.Second,
        TLSHandshakeTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
        ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
        TLSClientConfig:       &tls.Config{
        // your config here...
        },
    },
}
trino.RegisterCustomClient("foobar", foobarClient)
db, err := sql.Open("trino", "https://user@localhost:8080?custom_client=foobar")
```

#### Examples

```
http://user@localhost:8080?source=hello&catalog=default&schema=foobar
```

```
https://user@localhost:8443?session_properties=query_max_run_time=10m,query_priority=2
```

## Data types

### Query arguments

When passing arguments to queries, the driver supports the following Go data types:
* integers
* `bool`
* `string`
* slices
* `trino.Numeric` - a string representation of a number
* `time.Time` - passed to Trino as a timestamp with a time zone
* the result of `trino.Date(year, month, day)` - passed to Trino as a date
* the result of `trino.Time(hour, minute, second, nanosecond)` - passed to Trino as a time without a time zone
* the result of `trino.TimeTz(hour, minute, second, nanosecond, location)` - passed to Trino as a time with a time zone
* the result of `trino.Timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, nanosecond)` - passed to Trino as a timestamp without a time zone

It's not yet possible to pass:
* `nil`
* `float32` or `float64`
* `byte`
* `time.Duration`
* `json.RawMessage`
* maps

To use the unsupported types, pass them as strings and use casts in the query, like so:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE col_double = cast(? AS DOUBLE) OR col_timestamp = CAST(? AS TIMESTAMP)
```

### Response rows

When reading response rows, the driver supports most Trino data types, except:
* time and timestamps with precision - all time types are returned as
  `time.Time`. All precisions up to nanoseconds (`TIMESTAMP(9)` or `TIME(9)`)
  are supported (since this is the maximum precision Golang's `time.Time`
  supports). If a query returns columns defined with a greater precision,
  values will be trimmed to 9 decimal digits. Use `CAST` to reduce the returned
  precision, or convert the value to a string that then can be parsed manually.
* `DECIMAL` - returned as string
* `IPADDRESS` - returned as string
* `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH` and `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND` - returned as string
* `UUID` - returned as string

Data types like `HyperLogLog`, `SetDigest`, `QDigest`, and `TDigest` are not supported and cannot be returned from a query.

For reading nullable columns, use:
* `trino.NullTime`
* `trino.NullMap` - which stores a map of `map[string]interface{}`
or similar structs from the `database/sql` package, like `sql.NullInt64`

To read query results containing arrays or maps, pass one of the following structs to the `Scan()` function:

* `trino.NullSliceBool`
* `trino.NullSliceString`
* `trino.NullSliceInt64`
* `trino.NullSliceFloat64`
* `trino.NullSliceTime`
* `trino.NullSliceMap`

For two or three dimensional arrays, use `trino.NullSlice2Bool` and `trino.NullSlice3Bool` or equivalents for other data types.

To read `ROW` values, implement the `sql.Scanner` interface in a struct. Its `Scan()` function
will receive a `[]interface{}` slice, with values of the following types:
* `bool`
* `json.Number` for any numeric Trino types
* `[]interface{}` for Trino arrays
* `map[string]interface{}` for Trino maps
* `string` for other Trino types, as character, date, time, or timestamp
